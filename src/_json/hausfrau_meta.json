      "Anna lives in comfort with her husband and three young children in Zurich. Anna has chosen this life far from home; but inside she is falling apart. Anna attempts to assert her agency in the only way that makes sense to her: by engaging in intense sexual affairs. But when Anna finds herself crossing a line, she will set off a terrible chain of events that will end in unspeakable tragedy."
