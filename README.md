## Literature Atlas

This is a student project for Multimedia Cartography 2018 at ETH Zurich.

The overall design and idea was generated from the entire group. Each student had to chose a book which includes a lot of geographic information about the content in it. The task was to develop a web application(literature atlas) which shows the content of the book and explains it through an interactive web map view.
